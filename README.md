# AgentScope Sample Agents

Welcome to the **AgentScope Sample Agents** repository! 🎯
This repository provides **ready-to-use Python sample agents** built on top of:

- [AgentScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope)
- [AgentScope Runtime](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-runtime)

The examples cover a wide range of use cases — from lightweight command-line agents to **full-stack deployable applications** with both backend and frontend.

------

## 📖 About AgentScope & AgentScope Runtime

### **AgentScope**

AgentScope is a multi-agent framework designed to provide a **simple and efficient** way to build **LLM-powered agent applications**. It offers abstractions for defining agents, integrating tools, managing conversations, and orchestrating multi-agent workflows.

### **AgentScope Runtime**

AgentScope Runtime is a **comprehensive runtime framework** that addresses two key challenges in deploying and operating agents:

1. **Effective Agent Deployment** – Scalable deployment and management of agents across environments.
2. **Sandboxed Tool Execution** – Secure, isolated execution of tools and external actions.

It includes **context management** and **secure sandboxing**, and can be used with **AgentScope** or other agent frameworks.

------

## ✨ Getting Started

- All samples are **Python-based**.
- Samples are organized **by functional use case**.
- Some samples use only **AgentScope** (pure Python agents).
- Others use **both AgentScope and AgentScope Runtime** to implement **full-stack deployable applications** with frontend + backend.
- Full-stack runtime versions have folder names ending with:
  **`_fullstack_runtime`**

> 📌 **Before running** any example, check its `README.md` for installation and execution instructions.

### Install Requirements

- [AgentScope Documentation](https://doc.agentscope.io/)
- [AgentScope Runtime Documentation](https://runtime.agentscope.io/)
